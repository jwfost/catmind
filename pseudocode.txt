Overview
==========
* basic analogy is that thinking ~ catalytic reaction-diffusion system:
* working memory ~ reaction vessel
* concepts ~ molecules (reactants, products, and enzymes)
* spotlight of attention ~ local heating
* gamma binding ~ covalent & ionic binding
* looping into the world (outputting on the input space) ~ extended mind
* sliding window of time to calculate probabilities of co-occurrence

Details
===========
* Concept: composed of 0+ concepts
* Types of reactions:
  - Combination
      * Q: What can a new combination catalyze?
      * A:
  - Decomposition
      * Only possible if a concept has 2+ components
      * Q: How do we know what the components can catalyze?
        - A: We must start with elemental concepts whose catalytic activity we know.



Main Loop
===========
* read from a page to get some perceptions in working memory
  - read k random lines, where k size of working memory
  - each reading resets activation to 1.0
  - all unperturbed activations decay exponentially
* shine spotlight of attention on a subset of working memory
  - this increases local temperature
  - possibly surpasses activation energy for some reaction
* determine all possible reactions for contents of working memory
  - for a particular pair of concepts:
    * calculate energy of bound concepts
    * calculate energy of unbound concepts (sum)
    - result will be a probability
    - flip a p-biased coin to decide whether the reaction proceeds
* if a new conceptual product is produced, write that on the page
* whenever two concepts are simultaneously active, decrement their binding energy
* if activation > 80%, concept enters working memory (consciousness), displacing lowest activation entry there
